This is a web scraping app that I built with some basic functionality using BeautifulSoup in Python.\n
I've been reading Pitchfork for years now, and recently I've been getting a little exhausted by the sponsored content and just the general Conde Nastiness of it all.
It goes to Pitchfork.com and returns high-level summary of the featured reviews, including artist, title, genre, abstract, and the ever-important Score/BNM info.\n
I know, I know what you're thinking, but it was a good way to get familiar with BeautifulSoup, and it will actually automate a few clicks out of my day.
